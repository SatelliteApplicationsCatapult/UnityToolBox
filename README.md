# SAC Unity Tool Box

This is a collection of scripts to enable simple things in unity. Each script should do one small function.

## Scripts

### FollowObject

This script should be applied to a gui object, given a target gameobject it will cause the ui element to follow that object around the screen.

### LineTo

This script should be applied to a GameObject with a LineRenderer. Given a source GUI element and a target game object it will update the LineRenderer so it goes between the two objects.
